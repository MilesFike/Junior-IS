\maketitle

In your proposal, you will provide justification on why your project matters based on work which has been done in this area, using in-line citations

This project will attempt to utilize MCP (Model Context Protocol) to link an input image, a controller that scores complexity or identifies the type of text, and a series of specialized computer vision systems that may try to read the text. The goal of the system will be to ensure that an image is processed using the specific AI that best suits its needs. The controller could work by identifying the style of an individual letter. From there, the style of the letter will be used to select a computer vision system specified to that exact font or historical style of text, like medieval gothic.
