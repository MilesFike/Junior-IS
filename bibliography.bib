  annote    = {This is a popular algorithms textbook which is well-cited. In particular, Part VI on graph algorithms will be of interest. Chapter 26 discusses flow networks and introduces commonly used notation. It formally describes the problem of obtaining a maximum flow and its equivalence to obtaining a minimum cut. The classical method of Ford and Fulkerson's algorithm for finding a maximum flow is described, and it includes several examples. Additional methods for obtaining a maximum flow, including the push-relabel method, are also described. The chapter notes include additional references to specific articles which may be helpful, such as those of historical interest (the article in which an algorithm was originally proposed) as well as state-of-the-art improvements (more recent articles to improve the approach).}
